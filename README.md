# Stylized-Facts-of-Emerging-Cryptocurrency Markets
This repository contains code for the OMMS Dissertation "Stylized Facts of Emerging Cryptocurrencies" at the University of Oxford.

For the data sets used, see the folder "data". The folder currently contains time series data for 5 cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. For the Python script that downloaded the data, see "fetch data.py". 

The Python scripts "display leverage effect.py" and "display sesaonality.py" analyze the leverage effect and the seasonality effects - weekly and daily - for the above currencies using the csv files in "data".
